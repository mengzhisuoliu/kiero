<h1 align="center">! ATTENTION !</h1>
At the beginning, I would like to thank everyone who puts stars and says kind words. This gives me an incentive to move on. Thank you for that. But today I have bad news for you, all my projects and work are under threat.
My computer broke down and this means that I will not be able to develop this and other projects, as well as help people with their issues.
Since I don't have enough money and I believe that the world is not without good people, I am releasing this unfinished version of kiero so that you can see that the project is really developing, and if you want it to develop further, help raise money to fix my computer. According to my calculations, I need about $140. I will be glad and very grateful for any donation.
